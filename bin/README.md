Implements all the common docker cli commands except for login and logout because I don't want to have to deal with credential helpers

```
run         Create and run a new container from an image
exec        Execute a command in a running container
ps          List containers

pull        Download an image from a registry
push        Upload an image to a registry
images      List images
login       Log in to a registry
logout      Log out from a registry
search      Search Docker Hub for images
version     Show the Docker version information

```
